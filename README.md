### NEURON version of model:

This model was originally developed in [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/)

More details on the original NEURON version of this model [here](https://github.com/andrisecker/Poirazi2003-CA1Pyr/tree/master/ModelDB_NEURON) ([as submitted to ModelDB](https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/showModel.cshtml?model=20212)) 

In addition we created a simplified NEURON version, with a single cell and current clamp (in order to create a .mep file, which against LEMS/NeuroML2 implementation could be tested). More detailes on this NEURON version [here](https://github.com/andrisecker/Poirazi2003-CA1Pyr/tree/master/NEURON)
